# Ruin Run

...is a minimalistic mode 3 GBA game where you dodge paintballs to find the jungle treasure! This was a very open ended project, so I made something simple yet timeless. The theme is supposed to be akin to temple run, though its really not like temple run in any way at all.

## Welcome to the jungle!
Your objective is to collect 5 crystals and unlock the exit. A constant stream of paintballs (implemented with object pooling) will hinder you, depleting your 3 lives. Losing all of them results in a jungle creature eating your corpse. A ruin-raider's hat in the center of the map will help you dodge and weave faster, as well as free you of the CURSE. If you for some reason try to exit without the treasure, you will be cursed, and will never leave alive! Don't fret, as while the game is paused, the same jungle creature will leave behind a spare hat for you. How thoughtful!

## Controls
- DPAD - movement

- SELECT - return to start from pause

## How to run
A Gameboy Advance, or GBA emulator is required to play this game.
I recommend mGBA as that's what we used in class.
I've only uploaded the final Project.gba ROM.
If you have the physical hardware to run it, you totally can!
This has been tested on a real working GBA, just plop the ROM file into a microSD / SD slot cartridge and voila!
